1,"And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.",HEBREWS 1:6,HEBREWS 1:7,HEBREWS 1:9,HEBREWS 2:6,1
2,"And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angles spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.",HEBREWS 1:6,HEBREWS 1:7,HEBREWS 1:9,HEBREWS 2:6,2
3,"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.",HEBREWS 1:6,HEBREWS 1:7,HEBREWS 1:9,HEBREWS 2:6,3
4,"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man that thou visites him?",HEBREWS 1:6,HEBREWS 1:7,HEBREWS 1:9,HEBREWS 2:6,4
5,"For it became him, for whom all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.",HEBREWS 2:10,HEBREWS 2:14,HEBREWS 2:18,HEBREWS 3:4,1
6,"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;",HEBREWS 2:10,HEBREWS 2:14,HEBREWS 2:18,HEBREWS 3:4,2
7,"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.",HEBREWS 2:10,HEBREWS 2:14,HEBREWS 2:18,HEBREWS 3:4,3
8,For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.,HEBREWS 2:10,HEBREWS 2:14,HEBREWS 2:18,HEBREWS 3:4,4
9,"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.",HEBREWS 3:12,HEBREWS 3:14,HEBREWS 3:19,HEBREWS 4:1,1
10,"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;",HEBREWS 3:12,HEBREWS 3:14,HEBREWS 3:19,HEBREWS 4:1,2
11,So we see that they could not enter in beacuse of unbelief.,HEBREWS 3:12,HEBREWS 3:14,HEBREWS 3:19,HEBREWS 4:1,3
12,"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.",HEBREWS 3:12,HEBREWS 3:14,HEBREWS 3:19,HEBREWS 4:1,4
13,"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.",HEBREWS 4:1,HEBREWS 4:2,HEBREWS 4:11,HEBREWS 4:12,2
14,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.",HEBREWS 4:1,HEBREWS 4:2,HEBREWS 4:11,HEBREWS 4:12,3
15,"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.",HEBREWS 4:1,HEBREWS 4:2,HEBREWS 4:11,HEBREWS 4:12,4
16,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.",HEBREWS 4:12,HEBREWS 4:14,HEBREWS 4:15,HEBREWS 4:16,2
17,"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.",HEBREWS 4:12,HEBREWS 4:14,HEBREWS 4:15,HEBREWS 4:16,3
18,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.",HEBREWS 4:12,HEBREWS 4:14,HEBREWS 4:15,HEBREWS 4:16,4
19,"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;",HEBREWS 5:8,HEBREWS 5:9,HEBREWS 5:10,HEBREWS 5:12,1
20,"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;",HEBREWS 5:8,HEBREWS 5:9,HEBREWS 5:10,HEBREWS 5:12,2
21,Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.,HEBREWS 5:8,HEBREWS 5:9,HEBREWS 5:10,HEBREWS 5:12,3
22,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.",HEBREWS 5:8,HEBREWS 5:9,HEBREWS 5:10,HEBREWS 5:12,4
23,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.,HEBREWS 5:13,HEBREWS 5:14,HEBREWS 6:1,HEBREWS 6:4,1
24,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.",HEBREWS 5:13,HEBREWS 5:14,HEBREWS 6:1,HEBREWS 6:4,2
25,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,",HEBREWS 5:13,HEBREWS 5:14,HEBREWS 6:1,HEBREWS 6:4,3
26,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,",HEBREWS 5:13,HEBREWS 5:14,HEBREWS 6:1,HEBREWS 6:4,4
27,"And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,",HEBREWS 6:5,HEBREWS 6:6,HEBREWS 6:10,HEBREWS 6:12,1
28,"If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.",HEBREWS 6:5,HEBREWS 6:6,HEBREWS 6:10,HEBREWS 6:12,2
29,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.",HEBREWS 6:5,HEBREWS 6:6,HEBREWS 6:10,HEBREWS 6:12,3

31,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.",HEBREWS 7:19,HEBREWS 7:28,HEBREWS 8:10,HEBREWS 8:12,1
32,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.",HEBREWS 7:19,HEBREWS 7:28,HEBREWS 8:10,HEBREWS 8:12,2
33,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:",HEBREWS 7:19,HEBREWS 7:28,HEBREWS 8:10,HEBREWS 8:12,3
34,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.",HEBREWS 7:19,HEBREWS 7:28,HEBREWS 8:10,HEBREWS 8:12,4
35,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:",HEBREWS 9:13,HEBREWS 9:14,HEBREWS 9:16,HEBREWS 9:22,1
36,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?",HEBREWS 9:13,HEBREWS 9:14,HEBREWS 9:16,HEBREWS 9:22,2
37,"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.",HEBREWS 9:13,HEBREWS 9:14,HEBREWS 9:16,HEBREWS 9:22,3
38,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.,HEBREWS 9:13,HEBREWS 9:14,HEBREWS 9:16,HEBREWS 9:22,4
39,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:",HEBREWS 9:22,HEBREWS 9:24,HEBREWS 9:27,HEBREWS 9:28,2
40,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement:",HEBREWS 9:22,HEBREWS 9:24,HEBREWS 9:27,HEBREWS 9:28,3
41,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.,HEBREWS 9:22,HEBREWS 9:24,HEBREWS 9:27,HEBREWS 9:28,4
42,For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.,HEBREWS 10:4,HEBREWS 10:7,HEBREWS 10:19,HEBREWS 10:20,1
43,"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.",HEBREWS 10:4,HEBREWS 10:7,HEBREWS 10:19,HEBREWS 10:20,2
44,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.",HEBREWS 10:4,HEBREWS 10:7,HEBREWS 10:19,HEBREWS 10:20,3
45,"By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;",HEBREWS 10:19,HEBREWS 10:20,HEBREWS 10:21,HEBREWS 10:22,2
46,And having an high priest over the house of God;,HEBREWS 10:19,HEBREWS 10:20,HEBREWS 10:21,HEBREWS 10:22,3
47,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.",HEBREWS 10:19,HEBREWS 10:20,HEBREWS 10:21,HEBREWS 10:22,4
48,Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;),HEBREWS 10:23,HEBREWS 10:25,HEBREWS 10:26,HEBREWS 10:27,1
49,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.",HEBREWS 10:23,HEBREWS 10:25,HEBREWS 10:26,HEBREWS 10:27,2
50,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,",HEBREWS 10:23,HEBREWS 10:25,HEBREWS 10:26,HEBREWS 10:27,3
51,"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.",HEBREWS 10:23,HEBREWS 10:25,HEBREWS 10:26,HEBREWS 10:27,4
52,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.,HEBREWS 10:31,HEBREWS 10:35,HEBREWS 10:36,HEBREWS 10:38,1
53,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.",HEBREWS 10:31,HEBREWS 10:35,HEBREWS 10:36,HEBREWS 10:38,2
54,"For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.",HEBREWS 10:31,HEBREWS 10:35,HEBREWS 10:36,HEBREWS 10:38,3
55,"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.",HEBREWS 10:35,HEBREWS 10:36,HEBREWS 10:38,HEBREWS 10:39,3
56,But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.,HEBREWS 10:35,HEBREWS 10:36,HEBREWS 10:38,HEBREWS 10:39,4
57,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.",HEBREWS 11:1,HEBREWS 11:3,HEBREWS 11:5,HEBREWS 11:6,1
58,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.",HEBREWS 11:1,HEBREWS 11:3,HEBREWS 11:5,HEBREWS 11:6,2

60,"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.",HEBREWS 11:1,HEBREWS 11:3,HEBREWS 11:5,HEBREWS 11:6,4

63,"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:",HEBREWS 11:13,HEBREWS 11:16,HEBREWS 11:39,HEBREWS 11:40,3

68,"But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards, and not sons.",HEBREWS 12:1,HEBREWS 12:2,HEBREWS 12:6,HEBREWS 12:8,4
69,"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?",HEBREWS 12:9,HEBREWS 12:10,HEBREWS 12:12,HEBREWS 12:13,1
70,"For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness",HEBREWS 12:9,HEBREWS 12:10,HEBREWS 12:12,HEBREWS 12:13,2
