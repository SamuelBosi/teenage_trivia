2,"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.",ROMANS 1:16,ROMANS 1:17,ROMANS 1:18,ROMANS 1:20,2
3,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;",ROMANS 1:16,ROMANS 1:17,ROMANS 1:18,ROMANS 1:20,3
4,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:",ROMANS 1:16,ROMANS 1:17,ROMANS 1:18,ROMANS 1:20,4
5,"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.",ROMANS 1:21,ROMANS 1:22,ROMANS 1:28,ROMANS 1:32,1
6,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,",ROMANS 1:21,ROMANS 1:22,ROMANS 1:28,ROMANS 1:32,2
7,"And even as they did  not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.",ROMANS 1:21,ROMANS 1:22,ROMANS 1:28,ROMANS 1:32,3
8,"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.",ROMANS 1:21,ROMANS 1:22,ROMANS 1:28,ROMANS 1:32,4
9,For there is no respect of persons with God.,ROMANS 2:11,ROMANS 2:13,ROMANS 2:15,ROMANS 2:16,1
10,"(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.",ROMANS 2:11,ROMANS 2:13,ROMANS 2:15,ROMANS 2:16,2
11,"Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)",ROMANS 2:11,ROMANS 2:13,ROMANS 2:15,ROMANS 2:16,3
12,In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel,ROMANS 2:11,ROMANS 2:13,ROMANS 2:15,ROMANS 2:16,4
13,"Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?",ROMANS 2:21,ROMANS 3:4,ROMANS 3:20,ROMANS 3:23,1

15,Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.,ROMANS 2:21,ROMANS 3:4,ROMANS 3:20,ROMANS 3:23,3
16,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;",ROMANS 2:21,ROMANS 3:4,ROMANS 3:20,ROMANS 3:23,4
17,"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.",ROMANS 4:3,ROMANS 4:8,ROMANS 4:11,ROMANS 4:12,1
18,Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.,ROMANS 4:3,ROMANS 4:8,ROMANS 4:11,ROMANS 4:12,2
19,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:",ROMANS 4:3,ROMANS 4:8,ROMANS 4:11,ROMANS 4:12,3

22,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;",ROMANS 4:20,ROMANS 4:21,ROMANS 5:1,ROMANS 5:3,2
23,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:",ROMANS 4:20,ROMANS 4:21,ROMANS 5:1,ROMANS 5:3,3
24,"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;",ROMANS 4:20,ROMANS 4:21,ROMANS 5:1,ROMANS 5:3,4
25,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:",ROMANS 5:4,ROMANS 5:5,ROMANS 5:6,ROMANS 5:7,1
26,And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.,ROMANS 5:4,ROMANS 5:5,ROMANS 5:6,ROMANS 5:7,2
27,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.",ROMANS 5:4,ROMANS 5:5,ROMANS 5:6,ROMANS 5:7,3
28,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.,ROMANS 5:4,ROMANS 5:5,ROMANS 5:6,ROMANS 5:7,4
29,"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:",ROMANS 5:12,ROMANS 5:20,ROMANS 5:21,ROMANS 6:1,1
30,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:",ROMANS 5:12,ROMANS 5:20,ROMANS 5:21,ROMANS 6:1,2
31,"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.",ROMANS 5:12,ROMANS 5:20,ROMANS 5:21,ROMANS 6:1,3
32,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?",ROMANS 5:12,ROMANS 5:20,ROMANS 5:21,ROMANS 6:1,4

38,For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.,ROMANS 6:16,ROMANS 6:23,ROMANS 7:5,ROMANS 7:6,2
39,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.",ROMANS 6:16,ROMANS 6:23,ROMANS 7:5,ROMANS 7:6,3
40,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.",ROMANS 6:16,ROMANS 6:23,ROMANS 7:5,ROMANS 7:6,4
41,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.",ROMANS 7:11,ROMANS 7:15,ROMANS 7:18,ROMANS 7:23,1
42,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.",ROMANS 7:11,ROMANS 7:15,ROMANS 7:18,ROMANS 7:23,2
43,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.",ROMANS 7:11,ROMANS 7:15,ROMANS 7:18,ROMANS 7:23,3
44,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.",ROMANS 7:11,ROMANS 7:15,ROMANS 7:18,ROMANS 7:23,4
45,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.",ROMANS 8:1,ROMANS 8:2,ROMANS 8:3,ROMANS 8:5,1
46,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.,ROMANS 8:1,ROMANS 8:2,ROMANS 8:3,ROMANS 8:5,2
47,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:",ROMANS 8:1,ROMANS 8:2,ROMANS 8:3,ROMANS 8:5,3
48,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.,ROMANS 8:1,ROMANS 8:2,ROMANS 8:3,ROMANS 8:5,4
49,For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.,ROMANS 8:6,ROMANS 8:8,ROMANS 8:9,ROMANS 8:10,1
50,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.,ROMANS 8:6,ROMANS 8:8,ROMANS 8:9,ROMANS 8:10,2
51,"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.",ROMANS 8:6,ROMANS 8:8,ROMANS 8:9,ROMANS 8:10,3
52,"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.",ROMANS 8:6,ROMANS 8:8,ROMANS 8:9,ROMANS 8:10,4
53,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.",ROMANS 8:11,ROMANS 8:13,ROMANS 8:14,ROMANS 8:15,1
54,"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.",ROMANS 8:11,ROMANS 8:13,ROMANS 8:14,ROMANS 8:15,2
55,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.",ROMANS 8:11,ROMANS 8:13,ROMANS 8:14,ROMANS 8:15,3
56,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.",ROMANS 8:11,ROMANS 8:13,ROMANS 8:14,ROMANS 8:15,4
57,"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:",ROMANS 8:16,ROMANS 8:18,ROMANS 8:19,ROMANS 8:22,1
58,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.,ROMANS 8:16,ROMANS 8:18,ROMANS 8:19,ROMANS 8:22,2
59,For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.,ROMANS 8:16,ROMANS 8:18,ROMANS 8:19,ROMANS 8:22,3
60,For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.,ROMANS 8:16,ROMANS 8:18,ROMANS 8:19,ROMANS 8:22,4
61,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?",ROMANS 8:24,ROMANS 8:25,ROMANS 8:26,ROMANS 8:27,1
62,"But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.",ROMANS 8:24,ROMANS 8:25,ROMANS 8:26,ROMANS 8:27,2
63,Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.,ROMANS 8:24,ROMANS 8:25,ROMANS 8:26,ROMANS 8:27,3
64,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.",ROMANS 8:24,ROMANS 8:25,ROMANS 8:26,ROMANS 8:27,4
65,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.",ROMANS 8:28,ROMANS 8:29,ROMANS 8:30,ROMANS 8:31,1
66,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.",ROMANS 8:28,ROMANS 8:29,ROMANS 8:30,ROMANS 8:31,2
67,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.",ROMANS 8:28,ROMANS 8:29,ROMANS 8:30,ROMANS 8:31,3
68,"What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?",ROMANS 8:28,ROMANS 8:29,ROMANS 8:30,ROMANS 8:31,4
69,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.,ROMANS 8:33,ROMANS 8:34,ROMANS 8:35,ROMANS 8:37,1
70,"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.",ROMANS 8:33,ROMANS 8:34,ROMANS 8:35,ROMANS 8:37,2
71,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?",ROMANS 8:33,ROMANS 8:34,ROMANS 8:35,ROMANS 8:37,3
72,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.",ROMANS 8:33,ROMANS 8:34,ROMANS 8:35,ROMANS 8:37,4
73,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,",ROMANS 8:38,ROMANS 8:39,ROMANS 9:13,ROMANS 9:15,1
74,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.",ROMANS 8:38,ROMANS 8:39,ROMANS 9:13,ROMANS 9:15,2
75,"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.",ROMANS 8:38,ROMANS 8:39,ROMANS 9:13,ROMANS 9:15,3
76,"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.",ROMANS 8:38,ROMANS 8:39,ROMANS 9:13,ROMANS 9:15,4
77,"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.",ROMANS 9:16,ROMANS 9:17,ROMANS 9:20,ROMANS 9:33,1
78,"For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.",ROMANS 9:16,ROMANS 9:17,ROMANS 9:20,ROMANS 9:33,2
79,"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?",ROMANS 9:16,ROMANS 9:17,ROMANS 9:20,ROMANS 9:33,3
80,"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.",ROMANS 9:16,ROMANS 9:17,ROMANS 9:20,ROMANS 9:33,4
81,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.,ROMANS 10:4,ROMANS 10:6,ROMANS 10:7,ROMANS 10:8,1
82,"But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)",ROMANS 10:4,ROMANS 10:6,ROMANS 10:7,ROMANS 10:8,2
83,"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)",ROMANS 10:4,ROMANS 10:6,ROMANS 10:7,ROMANS 10:8,3

87,"For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.",ROMANS 10:9,ROMANS 10:10,ROMANS 10:11,ROMANS 10:13,3
88,For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.,ROMANS 10:9,ROMANS 10:10,ROMANS 10:11,ROMANS 10:13,4
89,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?,ROMANS 10:14,ROMANS 10:15,ROMANS 10:17,ROMANS 11:12,1
90,"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!",ROMANS 10:14,ROMANS 10:15,ROMANS 10:17,ROMANS 11:12,2
91,"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.",ROMANS 10:14,ROMANS 10:15,ROMANS 10:17,ROMANS 11:12,3
92,"Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?",ROMANS 10:14,ROMANS 10:15,ROMANS 10:17,ROMANS 11:12,4
93,"For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?",ROMANS 11:15,ROMANS 11:21,ROMANS 11:25,ROMANS 11:29,1
94,"For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.",ROMANS 11:15,ROMANS 11:21,ROMANS 11:25,ROMANS 11:29,2
95,"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.",ROMANS 11:15,ROMANS 11:21,ROMANS 11:25,ROMANS 11:29,3
96,For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.,ROMANS 11:15,ROMANS 11:21,ROMANS 11:25,ROMANS 11:29,4
97,"For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.",ROMANS 11:32,ROMANS 11:33,ROMANS 11:34,ROMANS 11:36,1

99,For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?,ROMANS 11:32,ROMANS 11:33,ROMANS 11:34,ROMANS 11:36,3
100,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen",ROMANS 11:32,ROMANS 11:33,ROMANS 11:34,ROMANS 11:36,4
101,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.",ROMANS 12:1,ROMANS 12:2,ROMANS 12:3,ROMANS 12:6,1

112,"Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.",ROMANS 12:13,ROMANS 12:14,ROMANS 12:15,ROMANS 12:16,4
113,Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.,ROMANS 12:17,ROMANS 12:18,ROMANS 12:19,ROMANS 12:20,1
